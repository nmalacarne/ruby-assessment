An assessment of my Ruby skills

and saves and saves the info to a database.

Create a front end that shows a list of users by name. I should be able to click on a user
to see details for each. No special requirements for the UI.

`bundle install`

`ruby app.rb`

> NOTE: The database will be created in /db/, and will be deleted and recreated everytime 
> the script is run.
